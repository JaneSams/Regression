#Regression Project - Manhattan rent price prediction
Goal : Based on the dataset pulled from Kagal, we will show the rent price prediction by 3 different models as learned in the course so far.

1st part: organize the data and prepare it for the models . This includes manipulating the data by grouping features, normalization, targeting points, multiplying selected features and other techniques to help us analyze the data and prepare it as well as we can for the regressions models .

2nd Part: EDA process including plots and correlations between the different features of the data and see which of the features has strong or weak relations with the rent price.

3rd part: Fitting the linear regression, decision tree and knn models to our data and checking the performance of the models according to the changes we do in the data in order to get the best model with the minimum loss.

4th part: Conclusions and future directions
